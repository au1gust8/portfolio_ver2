      <h2>Henri Matisse</h2>
      <p>Born in rural northern France, Henri Matisse[Henri-Émile-Benoît Matisse] became one of the most highly regarded and most influential painters in Paris, although he did not have the passion for art until he was nineteen. He has made a reputation in various fields including painting, sculpture, and graphic art, including "paper-orientation" (cutouts). Matisse, who worked as an assistant to a lawyer in his late teens, began taking drawing classes.</p>
      <p class="hidden-xs"> After a few years of appendicitis surgery, he began to draw in earnest, with his passion for painting during his long recovery. In 1891, Matisse abandoned his legal studies and went to Paris to study painting; he took classes by William Adolf Bugro at the Julien Academy, and entered Echol de Bogar. There he learned painting from the symbolist artist Gustave Morrow</p>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab1">
      <h2>His works</h2>
      <p>His early works, including a large number of still life and landscape paintings, had dark shades; however, after a summer vacation in Brittany, his shades changed. Matisse began to paint lively pictures with natural shades of light, concentrating more on the reproduction of those who surrounded the body with vivid colored cloths than inanimate objects without vitality.</p>
      <p class="hidden-xs"> Having been impressed by impressionist painters, Matisse began experimenting with various painting styles and techniques of light. Having long admired the works of Eduard Mane and Paul Cezanne, Georges Pierre Sra and Paul Cignac, he purchased Cezanne's masterpiece The Bathers (1890–1892). In 1905 he became friends with Andre Drain. Together they traveled to southern France, studying how to express the colors and light there, where Matisse had said he would never see it anywhere else.</p>

    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tab2">
      <h2>Colleague</h2>
      <p> When Drain and Matisse first held a joint exhibition, critics who did not look good at the paintings displayed called them "Les Fauves" as they mocked them. This means 'beasts' in French, and critics will rain on the primacy of exhibitions. General spectators were shocked by the 'barbaric' use of colors in the paintings on display, as well as denouncing the theme of the painting as 'barbaric'. This earned the painters the nickname "The Beasts.</p>
      <p class="hidden-xs">"But as the fame of artists has risen and the number of people who are well received and sought for their paintings has also increased, the derogatory nuance of this nickname has diminished and has become a term referring to a single art movement called 'beastism'. In 1907 Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso became friends; they often socialized together and exchanged their works; their names are still mentioned together today as if they were a pair. Picasso and Matisse changed the shape of 20th-century art, and Matisse was never an impressionist painter, a neo-impressionist painter, or a Cubist painter. He admired them, and even experimented with the elements of their work, but always pursued his own art and created a unique style.</p>

    <h2>course of his life</h2>
   <p> Sergei Schuchin was one of Matisse's most important patrons; he regularly visited Paris, bought all the works in Matisse's studio, loaded them on board and returned to Russia. Schuchin was a wealthy businessman and owned a magnificent mansion in Moscow; he commissioned Matisse to paint two murals on his mansion, the theme of "music" and "dance". Matisse traveled to Moscow for this work, visiting numerous European cities along the way.</p>

<p class="hidden-xs"> After undergoing surgery for duodenal cancer in 1941, Matisse realized that standing in front of the easel was so painful that he could never draw again. But Matisse did not frustrate, and began working on his famous "paper ducking" - a task that could be done with the help of an assistant even lying in bed or in an armchair. The assistants in the workshop painted the bright, vivid colors of gua on paper, and Matisse cut the paper into the form he wanted and placed it on the canvas. Matisse loved this new art form of abstract and simple style. He said he was able to achieve 'much higher perfection' through the paper duck than his paintings and sculptures.</p>
